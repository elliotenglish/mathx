# code_testing

code_testing is designed to be used with gtest. It provides the following:

- A main function which configures and calls all gtest.
- Configuration utilities allowing the user to control certain common functionalities such as logging and visualization (set the environment variable `DEBUG_VISUALIZE=1`, this will be made into a command line argument in the future).
